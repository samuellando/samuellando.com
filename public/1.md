## Introduction
This post goes over the vivsion, goals and ambitions of this new personal blog.

## TL;DR 
This blog will serve as a way to rigorusly document my work, both how it 
was done, and what I wish I would've know beforehand. My overall goal with this 
is to show my work, and to develop more clarity of mind by considering the purpose
behind the things I do.

## The vision. 
First and foremost, this blog is for me. It's intended to get my ideas down,
document what I've done, organize my thoughts and to drive my productivity. The 
fact that it is public is simply to give myself more motivation to properly document
everythin, and not be lazy with my explanations. I don't really intend on having anyone read this.

With that said, I will be wrting this to the best of my ability, with the goal 
of publishing at least one post a week displaying work I've done, and referencing 
how I did it and what I wish I knew before going into it.

## Show my work.
This idea came from a YouTube video I watched [0] explaining the benefits of starting a 
blog, and benefits of showing off your work. This
is a fantastic video, very insipring, and I strongly recommend checking it out.

In this video Ali Abdaal explains how the book "Show Your Work" [2] by Austin Kleon
changed his life by showing him the importance of getting your work out there
and building you own brand. I will be sure to grab a copy of this book for my Kindle
for future reading.

## Clarity over my own throughts.
Another purpose for this blog is diven by the idea that simply writing things down in a clear way, will always 
be useful in understnding my own intentions and purpose behind things. Wheter it be explaining
a concept, or looking into my goals with a certain project.

## My ambition
For the moment I would like to document the transformation of my personal 
website. The goal is minimum one post a week.
