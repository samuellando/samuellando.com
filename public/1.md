## TL;DR 
This post goes over what my initial goals are with this blog. 

It's purpose is simply to document stuff that I am working on/have already 
worked on and I think is worth sharing.

## The vision. 
First and foremost, this blog is for me. It's intended to get my ideas down,
document what I've done, organize my thoughts and to drive my productivity. The 
fact that it is public is simply to give myself a reason to write things properly,
and not be lazy. I don't really intend on having anyone read this.

With that said, I will be wrting this to the best of my ability, with the goal 
of publishing at least one post a week displaying work I've done, and referencing 
how I did it and what I wish I knew.

## Show my work.
This idea came from a YouTube video I watched [0] explaining the benefits of starting a 
blog, and benefits of showing off your work. This
is a fantastic video, very insipring, and I strongly recommend checking it out.

In this video Ali Abdaal explains how the book "Show Your Work" [2] by Austin Kleon
changed his life by showing him the importance of getting your work out there
and building you own brand. I will be sure to grab a copy of this book for my Kindle
for future reading.

## Clarity over my own throughts.
The idea here being that simply writing things down in a clear way, will always 
be useful in understnding my own intentions behind things. Wheter it be explaining
a concept, or looking into my goals with a certain project.

## My ambition
For the moment I would like to document the transformation of my personal 
website. The goal is minimum one post a week.
