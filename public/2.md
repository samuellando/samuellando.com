## Origins, and the pen addict podcast.
### My first "nice" pens
The first pen I've ever spent real money on was the Fisher Bullet Space Pen [[0]](#links). I was browsing a office supplies store, and picked it up.  This was a great pen, I really liked it as a math student at the time, I used it for hours every day. I eventually lost this pen, since I always carried it in my pocket, it probably fell out while I was on the bus or something. After that, I bought another one of these, but also lost it in the same way.

After I lost both Space Pens, I decided to buy my first ever fountain pen, from the same office supplies store. It was a Cross [[1]](#links). I Don't think they sell the model anymore, but I do still have it, and it is somewhere at my parent's house.

### Stepping things up
My minor interest in pens led me to a podcast I love listening to,  "The Pen Addict" [[2]](#links), where one of my favorite podcasters, Myke Hurley, from many great podcast in the Relay FM podcast network [[3]](#links), talks about pens with Brad Dowdy, from The Pen Addict Blog [[4]](#links).

While I had a minor interest in stationary before I started listening to The Pen Addict, I really began paying attention to it once I discovered this podcast. Apart from being great entertainment, this podcast really opened up my eyes to what good stationary products are available outside the standard stuff at an office supplies store. 

I quickly learnt that it was not necessary to spend a lot of money to get a good experience, at least not for me. I'm a very practical person, and while I do see the value in investing in good products that deliver a good experience, I am very weary of the law od diminishing returns [[5]](#links), where the increase in value obtained from a product is smaller as you get into the higher end. In terms of pens, a $50 fountain pen will deliver nearly the same writing experience, at least for me, as a $1000 pen, the main difference being in the aesthetics. 

My first fountain pen I bought after this was the TWSBI ECO [[6]](#links), chosen this list [[7]](#links) on Brad's blog. My main motivation to go for this one was that it had a built in converter, and I have no interest in using refills on any of my pens if possible. This pen is basically the only  pen that I still use today.

Along with pen's, the podcast quickly intoduced me to the importance of using good papers. And I've always stuck with RHODIA papers [[8]](#links), as they are Brad's top recommendation [[9]](#links). So far I've used many of the A7 side staple notebooks [[10]](#links), for a every day carry, as well as a A4 side staple notebook [[11]](#links), for random journaling. The paper quality on these is amazing.

## My wishlist right now
### Pens
The Kaweco Classic Sport [[12]](#links), from the same top 5 pens under 50 on Brad's blog [[7]](#links). I would want the aluminum version of this pen, but it is a bit too expensive for me.

Along with the pen, I want to get the converter [[13]](#links), and the clip [[14]](#links).

### Ink
I currently only have the Waterman Mysterious Blue Ink [[15]](#links), but I am growing pretty tired of it. I would like to have a new ink to mix it up sometimes, ideally every season.

This fall I would like to get a orange Ink. Brad actually has a list of his favorite oragnge inks [[16]](#links), and the one that my local stationary supplier has in stock is Pilot Iroshizuku Yu-yake Ink (Sunset) [[17]](#links). It's a bit expensive, but it should last me for years.

### Notebooks
I love RHODIA paper, and I want more. I will get notebooks for different needs:

- Groceries List: RHODIA A7 lined pad [[18]](#links)
- Coffee notes: RHODIA A7 lined pad [[18]](#links)
- Cooking notes: RHODIA A7 lined pad [[18]](#links)
- Gym notes: RHODIA A7 lined pad [[18]](#links)
- Misc note taking, sketching, ect. : RHODIA A4 dot-grid pad [[19]](#links)
- Idea planning and random journaling: RHODIA A4 side stapled lined notebook [[11]](#links)
- Pocket notebook: RHODIA A7 side stapled dot-grid notebook [[10]](#links)
- Journaling: The theme system journal [[20]](#links) by the hosts of the Cortex podcast [[21]](#links)
