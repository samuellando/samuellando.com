Quick post this week. As I haven't had much time to work on my own personal projects, so I thought I'd quickly hammer one out last minute this week while sticking with the current theme of "thing's I want, related to one of my hobbies". This week's hobby being coffee.

My current coffee setup consist of an espresso machine [[1]](#links), and a french press. In the mornings, or when I want to sit down and enjoy a cup, I make an espresso based drink. But when I'm working, and I want to slowly drink a cup while a I work, I usually make a cup with the french press. I consider these two types of coffee two entirely different things, that serve different purposes in my life. To get to the point, here is the list of things I want to upgrade my coffee setups with:

## Espresso setup

This mostly consists of parts for my machine, as inspired by this video [[2]](#links):

- A 51mm Bottomless portafilter [[3]](#links)
- A 51mm distributor [[4]](#links)
- A 51mm tamper [[5]](#links)
- A 12oz frothing pitcher [[6]](#links)
- A good grinder, I still haven't found one that I want.

## Brew setup

- An aeropress [[7]](#links).
- A v60 coffee dripper [[8]](#links)
